# Real_time_Data_Streaming_Pipeline_Kafka
This project implements a real-time data pipeline using Kafka producers to stream data and consumers to process and store it in S3. EC2 hosts the Kafka setup, while AWS Glue Crawlers catalog the data. Athena enables SQL-based querying of data stored in S3 for analysis.
